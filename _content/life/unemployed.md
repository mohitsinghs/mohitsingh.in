In India, the country where I live, cheating and bribery is part of the normal life. [India produces world's largest number of CS graduates each year, 90% of them are useless][1]. What do you expect from a population of computer programmers that can't code but want to earn money, specially in a country where cheating is a social norm ? Well, they will do everything in their capacity to cheat and earn. India is also know of it's brilliant minds. So, those who are genuinely interested in coding are extremely good at it, but being good alone is not something that will land you a job.

## Give them what they want

There are countless companies in india employing incompetent engineers, promising them good packages. The engineers there bid for foreign projects on various platforms with fake profiles or fake non-indian sounding names. Once they land in the project, the race to finish it with jugaad starts.

This is because those people on the other side have a perception that any indian sounding name will be an incompetent engineer. This kind of fraudsters are elsewhere as well, but large population of these fraudsters operate from India.

## Block the road

Liers are believed easily and the interview process is broken and that's why it's very difficult for some engineers to compete with this. There is another tendency in India that, you can sell anything if the packaging is good. The same engineers that are considered unemployable by companies, are appreciated when they go through consultancies, even if they are bad. The reason is these phantom companies called consultancies serve those engineers with a bunch of lies that pleases those employing them. In return, they take a cut.

Sometimes, this forms a chain of companies taking cuts. So while they think they are paying 10 for the resource, they end up paying 4-5. On the other hands, frauds end up gaming the interviews and serve in 2 or 3 jobs at once and sometime even 7.

## Way down we go

The engineers with ethics hate companies employing shady business practices. This limits the places where they can work because a lot of tech giants in India are exactly these. There is no end of dirt in this road.

Will these all be fixed anytime soon ? I don't think so. I am a CS graduate who was optimistic about his career a few years ago, dreaming of building things that'll change the world, but after going through all this crap and seeing it closely, I no longer believe that. My interaction to computers will be limited to open source and my experiments. I am thinking about moving to farming, because there, it's very hard to cheat the nature and maybe I can fulfil my dreams that way. There is fraud their as well, because I live in a country of frauds but that's okay.
