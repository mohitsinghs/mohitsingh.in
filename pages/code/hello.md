I tried blogging a few times during last 8 years, but ended up stopping every time, but now I finally feel like I have courage to write things in my mind. So, hello and welcome.

I'm Mohit and writing code is among various thing I do. This blog is intended to document and share my thoughts.

## Tech Stack

This blog is built with Next, since that's what I use for most of the sites, along with some custom code to make Next work as blogging platform. Styles are from TailwindCSS which I love and hate at the same time.
